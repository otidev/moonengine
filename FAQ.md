# Famously Answered Questions

## Why did you make Moon?
In the summer of 2022, I wanted to fully dedicate my self to make a game after failing multiple times. I picked up SDL and started developing, and here I am! 

## This has no editor, so it's not a game engine!
While you could state having an editor to be the only indication of a game engine, the codebase of Moon is at a such high level, it's more or less an engine (or at least a framework).

## Where can I find `$(FEATURE)`?
If you can't find what you are looking for, you can make it! Add it to the repo if you wish!

## NO DOCS!!!
Sorry, the current documentation (if you can call it that), is really simple. I might add Doxygen to it, though!

## Will you add CMake?
Yes, I will. After a some thinking I've decided to add CMake soon. Keep your eyes open!
